# Uploading your Streamlit app to GitHub

## GitHub

Git is a software for keeping track of all changes made to code (i.e. version control). GitHub is a Git repository hosting service that makes data and code publicly available on the web, which allows team collaboration and allow others to contribute to the repo.

Housing your Streamlit app in a GitHub repository will allow apps to be deployed to the cloud (the next challenge).

Sign up for GitHub
Firstly, sign up for a GitHub account.

Create a GitHub repository
Follow the following steps to create a GitHub repository:

In the top right hand corner, click on the "+" icon which should reveal a drop-down menu, then click on "New repository" (Figure 1).

This should bring to a new webpage called "Create a new repository". Under the "Repository name" field, enter a name for your repository, for example, helloworld (Figure 2).

Under the "Initialize this repository with:" field, tick on "Add a README file".

Finally, click on "Create repository" (Figure 3).

Your newly created repository will be available
